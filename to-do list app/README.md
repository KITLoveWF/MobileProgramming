This is a basic Android application developed in Kotlin that allows users to manage a list of tasks. Users can add tasks with specific due dates and sort the existing tasks either by name or by date.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Enter a task description and select a due date.  
- **Date Selection**: Use an integrated `DatePickerDialog` to easily pick a due date.  
- **Task List Display**: View all added tasks in a `RecyclerView`.  
- **Sort by Name**: Sort the task list alphabetically by task description via the options menu.  
- **Sort by Date**: Sort the task list chronologically by due date via the options menu.  

## How to Use

1. Launch the application.  
2. Enter the description of your task in the "Enter task..." input field.  
3. Click on the date text (initially showing the current date) to open the calendar and select a due date for the task.  
4. Click the "Add Task" button to add the task to the list.  
5. The task will appear in the list below.  
6. To sort the tasks, tap the options menu (three dots) in the top-right corner and select either "Sort by Name" or "Sort by Date".
